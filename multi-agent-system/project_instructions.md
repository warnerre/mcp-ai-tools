# Multi-Agent System with MCP

## Project Overview
Design a multi-agent system where different MCP servers handle specialized tasks with intelligent coordination and task distribution.

## Goals
- Build sophisticated multi-agent architecture with MCP coordination
- Implement specialized agents for different domains and tasks
- Create intelligent task routing and agent coordination
- Provide scalable and fault-tolerant multi-agent system

## Technical Requirements
- **MCP Framework**: Multiple specialized MCP servers
- **Agent Coordination**: Task routing and agent communication
- **Specialization**: Domain-specific agents (data, analysis, execution)
- **Orchestration**: Central coordinator for agent management
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling and load balancing

## Key Features
1. **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific MCP servers for different tasks
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Smart task distribution based on agent capabilities
3. **Agent Coordination**: Inter-agent communication and collaboration
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Agent health monitoring and automatic recovery
5. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatic agent scaling based on workload
6. **Task Orchestration**: Complex workflow execution across multiple agents
