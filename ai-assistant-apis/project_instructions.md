# AI Assistant with Multiple API Integration

## Project Overview
Implement an AI assistant that uses MCP to interact with multiple external APIs simultaneously for comprehensive task automation.

## Goals
- Build AI assistant with multi-API integration through MCP
- Create intelligent API orchestration and workflow automation
- Implement context-aware task execution across services
- Provide unified interface for complex multi-service operations

## Key Features
1. Multi-API Integration: Simultaneous interaction with multiple external APIs
2. Intelligent Orchestration: Context-aware API selection and coordination
3. Workflow Automation: Complex task automation across multiple services
4. Context Management: Maintaining context across API interactions
5. Error Handling: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
6. Performance Optimization: Parallel API calls and caching strategies

## Success Criteria
- Integrate with 20+ external APIs through MCP
- Execute complex multi-service workflows automatically
- Maintain 99.9% reliability in API orchestration
- Provide intelligent context-aware task automation
